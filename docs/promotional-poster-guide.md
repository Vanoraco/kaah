## Promotional Poster Carousel on Homepage

The promotional poster carousel automatically displays on your homepage. It shows all active posters based on their effective and expiry dates.

### Features:

- Automatically rotates through posters every 5 seconds
- Navigation arrows for manual browsing
- Dot indicators showing the current poster position
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Only displays posters that are currently active based on dates
- Compact poster thumbnails that expand to full-size when clicked
- Overlay display that doesn't require navigating away from the current page

## Viewing Full-Size Posters

Customers can view the full-size poster by:

1. Clicking on any poster image or the "View Poster" button in the carousel
2. This opens an overlay with the full-size poster image that appears on top of the current page
3. The overlay can be closed by clicking outside the poster or the close button

## URL Structure

- Homepage carousel: `https://your-store.com/`
- Full poster viewer: `https://your-store.com/promotional-posters/[poster-handle]`
- All posters page: `https://your-store.com/promotional-posters`

## Best Practices

### Image Preparation

1. **Recommended Image Size**:
   - Portrait orientation: 800px × 1200px
   - Landscape orientation: 1200px × 800px
   - Square: 1000px × 1000px

2. **File Format**:
   - Use PNG for images with transparency or text
   - Use JPG or WebP for photos to reduce file size
   - Keep file sizes under 500KB for optimal loading speed

3. **Design Tips**:
   - Ensure text is readable on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Use high contrast colors for better visibility
   - Include your store branding for consistency
   - Make sure important information is visible in the carousel thumbnail view

### Content Management

1. **Effective Date Management**:
   - Set appropriate effective and expiry dates to ensure timely promotions
   - For recurring promotions, create copies with updated dates
   - Remove or update expired posters regularly

2. **Organizing Posters**:
   - Use clear, descriptive titles for easier management
   - Include dates in the title for quick reference (e.g., "Summer Sale - June 2025")
   - Archive old posters by setting their expiry dates to past dates

## Troubleshooting

**Poster not appearing in carousel?**
- Check that the effective and expiry dates are set correctly
- Verify that the poster image was uploaded successfully
- Ensure the poster is saved and published

**Image appears distorted?**
- Check that your image dimensions follow the recommended ratio
- Try re-uploading the image in a different format
